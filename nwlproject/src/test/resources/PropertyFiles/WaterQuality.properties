waterQualityTeaser1 = Don't forget to check my area in case there are any problems we already know about.
waterQualityTeaser2 = Network issues in your area can sometimes affect your water supply.
whatSeemsToBeTheProblemLabel = What seems to be the problem?
CWSAffectingLabel = Is your cold water supply affected?
CWSAffectingInformationText = Check by running your cold tap
CWSAffectingTeaser_No  = If your cold water is unaffected, it's likely the problem is your plumbing. We recommend getting an approved WaterSafe plumber to take a look. You can find one at WaterSafe.
describeTOSOfWaterLabel = Can you describe the taste or smell of your water?
chlorineTeaser1 = Our water comes from different sources, like rivers, reservoirs and groundwater.
chlorineTeaser2 = This means you may notice a difference in taste between areas in the North East. These small differences are perfectly normal.
chlorineTeaser3 = Just moved home?
chlorineTeaser4 = If you have moved house, your water may come from a new source. You\u2032ll get used to the taste over time.
chlorineTeaser5 = Seasonal changes
chlorineTeaser6 = Seasonal changes also affect how our water tastes, because small tweaks may be needed in the treatment process. Chlorine may taste or smell stronger in the cold weather, too.
TCPOrMouthWashTeaser1 = We need to treat our water with chlorine in order to kill harmful bacteria.
TCPOrMouthWashTeaser2 = Now, for a bit of science. The chlorine we use to kill nasty bugs can react with plastic and rubber in your plumbing. This causes a taste or smell of TCP, mouthwash or antiseptic.
TCPOrMouthWashTeaser3 = But chlorine isn't the only suspect here!
TCPOrMouthWashTeaser4 = If the taste or smell is noticeable in hot drinks only, it could be down to your kettle.
TCPOrMouthWashTeaser5 = If your kettle is new, make sure to use fresh water every time you use it. If your kettle is older, and a bit worn, it may be time to replace it.
TCPOrMouthWashTeaser6 = If the taste or smell is noticeable in both hot and cold drinks, check your plumbing and fittings. Worn, damaged fittings should be replaced using a WaterSafe approved plumber.
staleOrMustyTeaser1 = Standing water
staleOrMustyTeaser2 = 'Musty' or 'stale' tastes and smells can be caused by standing water.
staleOrMustyTeaser3 = Top tip - if your home has stood empty for a while, run your cold water to flush out the pipes.
staleOrMustyTeaser4 = Blocked drains and pipes
staleOrMustyTeaser5 = If you only notice the smell when you\u2032re near the sink, make sure the sink and overflow are clean. Fats, greases and oils can build up in pipes, leading to bad smells and blockages.
staleOrMustyTeaser6 = Wash the sink drains with bleach and hot water. If the blockage is stubborn and won't shift after a good bleach, call in a reliable plumber.
staleOrMustyTeaser7 = Pipe insulation
staleOrMustyTeaser8 = Hot and cold water pipes that run close together must be properly lagged and insulated. This means the hot water supply can't heat the water in the cold supply.
metalTeaser1 = If you can taste metal in your water, it's likely to be metal pipework causing it.
metalTeaser2 = This taste or smell can be even more noticeable from the hot water supply.
metalTeaser3 = It can also be due to parts in the hot water system breaking down. Try running the hot water for a few minutes. If this doesn't help the taste or smell, you'll need to get the system checked.
eggOrFishTeaser1 = We've had a number of customers describe their water as 'eggy' or 'fishy', and the most common cause of this is a build up in the waste pipe and overflow.
eggOrFishTeaser2 = Top tip - try cleaning the sink and overflow with very hot water and bleach. Be sure to only use cleaning chemicals that are safe for your kitchen surfaces.
eggOrFishTeaser3 = Throw out old, disposable sponges and dishcloths.
eggOrFishTeaser4 = If the smell or taste continues, and your neighbours are unaffected, contact a reliable plumber.
dieselOrPetrolTeaser = It is very important you contact us, if you think your water tastes or smells like diesel or petrol. Please call us on 0345 717 1100.
woodyTastesOrSmellsTeaser1 = The taste is often described like the taste from chewing a pencil. It is often because certain plastic pipes are getting too old and need replacing.
woodyTastesOrSmellsTeaser2 = Woody taste and smells are not harmful and will probably get stronger as the pipe gets older.
TSInformationHelpedLabel = Has this information helped?
TSInformationHelpedTeaser_Yes = That's great news, thanks for your help!
callUsLabel = Please call us so we can help
phoneNumber = 0345 717 1100
whatColourIsYourWaterLabel = What colour is your water?
whiteAndCloudyTeaser = No need to worry about cloudy, white water if the colour and cloudiness settles. This is usually just tiny air bubbles, and your water is safe to drink.
blackOrangeOrBrownTeaser1 = The most common cause of discoloured, dark water is a disturbance in the water pipes.
blackOrangeOrBrownTeaser2 = Repair works or burst mains can cause harmless deposits to come loose inside the pipework. Check if there are any works in your area. Even works a mile away can affect your supply. You can also run your tap to see if clears.
blackOrangeOrBrownTeaser3 = This can take around 40 minutes. Don't use your water-reliant appliances such as washing machines and kettles, or your hot water supply, until the cold water tap runs clear again.
pinkBlueOrGreenTeaser1 = Strange colours like pink, green or blue water can be caused by a number of things.
pinkBlueOrGreenTeaser2 = Copper turns green over time, which can make your water turn the same colour. A misconnection is pipework that is connected to the wrong part of the system.
pinkBlueOrGreenTeaser3 = If you have pink, green or blue water, please call us on 0345 717 1100, so we can help.
biofilmAndMouldTeaser1 = Mould, stains and slime around your taps and tiles?
biofilmAndMouldTeaser2 = Stains are often pink or black, and stick to fittings and tiles. Sometimes, a black jelly can build up inside taps, and wash out into the sink.
biofilmAndMouldTeaser3 = This is caused by airborne spores that like to grow in warm, damp places. Bathrooms and kitchens are usually the perfect place for this to happen.
biofilmAndMouldTeaser4 = Mould, also known as biofilm, does not come from your water supply.
hardWaterTeaser1 = If you have hard water, you might notice white scale build up in your appliances and taps, or a sheen on the surface of hot drinks. It isn't harmful, but we understand it can be a nuisance.
hardWaterTeaser2 = You can reduce the effects of water hardness on your appliances by using a softener. A softener swaps calcium and magnesium with sodium.
hardWaterTeaser3 = Please know that we don't recommend using softeners on kitchen taps, especially for babies and people on sodium-restricted diets.
hardWaterTeaser4 = You can also reduce white scale build up on your kettle by only boiling the water once.
hardWaterTeaser5 = If you do wish to use a softener, please make sure it is installed by a WaterSafe approved plumber.
